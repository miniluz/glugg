# 1. Opening thoughts

I consider myself pretty good at doing front-end and back-end dev work.
But there are some skills I'm lacking, partly because I've never worked during the later stages of a project lifecycle.
Particularly, I've never really done efficiency, logging, monitoring, debugging and so on.
So my plan is to make a simple game that forces me to interact with other parts of the process.

## The game

It will be something like the world scrambles you see.
You will be given a random assortment of letters and will be challenged to find words with them.
The logic to check them should be pretty easy (just a dict)
and if I do a preflight check that you can form many words with the random letters of various lengths it should be good.
The back-end will mostly only be matchmaking.

I wanna use websockets for the back-end.
I'm contemplating whether I should make it with Rust or Nest
-- Nest is probably the right call, but we'll see.
I will be running it on my home server on Docker and exposing it through a Cloudflare tunnel, I think.
I should probably use something like Dokku to automate the process.

For the front-end, it should be compilable to static pages so I can serve it through GitHub pages.
Should keep hosting costs to the minimum, ideally.
I wonder if I could use JS with something like Preact or if just building it with React is viable.
NextJS seems to be able to do it, so it should be the right choice.
